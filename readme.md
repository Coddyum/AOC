# 🎄 Advent of Code in Go

I’m starting **Advent of Code** from **2015**.  
Why 2015? Because it’s the very first edition, and I like the idea of going through the puzzles in order, year after year.

## 🚀 Goals

-   Solve everything in **Go (Golang)**.
-   Learn and explore **new concepts** in Go.
-   Build solid **mastery of the language** through practice.
-   Keep a track of my **progression over time**.

## 🛠️ Motivation

-   Go is simple, clean, yet powerful when you dive deeper.
-   Advent of Code challenges push me to **think differently**, not just write code.
-   Main goal: **have fun, learn, and sharpen my skills**.
